# Data Structures & Algorithms Practices

Welcome to **Data Structures & Algorithms Practices**, a well-structured repository designed to help learners strengthen their understanding of fundamental computer science concepts. This repository contains well-documented implementations and detailed explanations of essential data structures and algorithms, making it an ideal resource for both self-study and practical coding exercises.

## üìå Purpose
This repository aims to:
- Provide a structured learning path for mastering core data structures and algorithms.
- Offer clean, efficient, and well-commented code implementations.
- Serve as a practical reference for students, competitive programmers, and software developers.
- Enhance problem-solving skills through hands-on coding challenges.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Covers essential topics such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, recursion, dynamic programming, sorting, searching, and more.
- **Detailed Explanations**: Each implementation includes clear documentation, usage scenarios, time complexity analysis, and trade-offs.
- **Multiple Programming Languages**: Implemented in `[language]` to ensure accessibility and performance (update as necessary).
- **Structured Learning Path**: Organized for both beginners and intermediate learners, with increasing levels of complexity.
- **Practical Examples**: Hands-on practice problems with real-world applications.
